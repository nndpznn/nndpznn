# Hello hello!

I'm Nolan. I'm a junior computer science major and business minor at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles(actually, as of Fall 2024, I'm studying abroad at Sogang University in South Korea!).

So far, I'm interested in front-end web development and user experience design, but I'm leaving the door open for other parts of the CompSci world. For now, I'm working on collecting skills to expand my abilities and get involved in all the steps of developing. 

In my spare time, my creative outlet of choice is making [videos](https://www.youtube.com/@-nolan). I also occasionally dabble in [cardistry](https://sabukaru.online/articles/the-last-living-niche-subculture-a-talk-with-anyone-master-of-cards), photography, guitar-playing, singing, fashion, gaming(just Destiny 2) and I'm trying very hard to get back into reading books.
