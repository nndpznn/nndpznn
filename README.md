# Hello hello!

I'm Nolan. I'm currently a sophomore computer science major and business minor at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles. 

I'm interested in something in the neighborhood of front-end development and user experience design. But, for now, I'm busy collecting skills like Pokemon to enable me to create whatever I want! 

In my spare time, I love making videos for myself and my school's student-run newspaper, the Los Angeles Loyolan. I also occasionally dabble in [cardistry](https://link-url-here.org](https://sabukaru.online/articles/the-last-living-niche-subculture-a-talk-with-anyone-master-of-cards)
