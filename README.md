# Hello hello!

***[PSST: Check my stars to find the projects I'm proudest of!!]***


I'm Nolan. I'm a senior computer science major and business minor at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles, hailing from the SF Bay. I graduate in May so I'm on the lookout for software engineer opportunities starting summer or fall 2026! 

Most recently, my internship at AWS [this past summer](https://lnkd.in/p/gsUnkYyn) introduced me to LLM-based agentic engineering, where I created an agent to investigate CloudWatch logs and identify the root cause of a given ongoing issue. I really believe agentic is the future of AI - assistants that can not only recommend actions but execute them for you, allowing us to focus on the more important parts of our work. 

Outside of work, a large proportion of my work has been in fullstack web dev. I've also spent time with mobile dev and neural network recommender systems. 

In my spare time, my creative outlet of choice is making [videos](https://www.youtube.com/@nolndn). I also occasionally dabble in photography, fashion, [cardistry](https://sabukaru.online/articles/the-last-living-niche-subculture-a-talk-with-anyone-master-of-cards), guitar-playing, singing, gaming(just Destiny 2) and I'm trying very hard to get back into reading books.
