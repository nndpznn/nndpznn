# Hello hello!

I'm Nolan. I'm currently a sophomore computer science major and business minor at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles. 

I'm interested in something in the neighborhood of front-end development and user experience design. But, for now, I'm busy collecting skills like Pokemon to enable me to create whatever I want. 

In my spare time, I love making videos for [myself](https://www.youtube.com/@-nolan) and my school's student-run newspaper, the [Los Angeles Loyolan](https://www.laloyolan.com/users/profile/nolan%20nguyen/). I also occasionally dabble in [cardistry](https://sabukaru.online/articles/the-last-living-niche-subculture-a-talk-with-anyone-master-of-cards), photography, guitar-playing, singing, fashion, gaming(just Destiny 2) and I'm trying very hard to get back into reading books.
