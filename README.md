# Hello hello!

***[PSST: Check my stars to find the projects I'm proudest of!!]***


I'm Nolan. I'm a senior computer science major and business minor at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles, hailing from the SF Bay. I graduate in May so I'm on the lookout for software engineer opportunities starting summer or fall 2026! 

Most recently, my internship at AWS [this past summer](https://lnkd.in/p/gsUnkYyn) introduced me to LLM-based agentic engineering, where I created an agent to investigate CloudWatch logs and identify the root cause of a given ongoing issue. I really believe agentic is the future of AI - assistants that can not only recommend actions but execute them for you, allowing us to focus on the more important parts of our work. 

Outside of that, I love designing and engineering user interfaces, because I believe for casual users of apps, presentation is everything. A large proportion of my work has been in fullstack web dev(mostly because I can't rely on anyone else to do my backend...). I've also spent time with mobile dev(Swift/SwiftUI) and neural network recommender systems(Pytorch). 

In my spare time, my creative outlet of choice is making [videos](https://www.youtube.com/@nolndn). I also occasionally dabble in photography, fashion, [cardistry](https://sabukaru.online/articles/the-last-living-niche-subculture-a-talk-with-anyone-master-of-cards), guitar-playing, singing, gaming(just Destiny 2) and I'm trying very hard to get back into reading books.
